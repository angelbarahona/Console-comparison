# PS4 contrast
**Ps4 has more of an expensive side but on the bright side Both the PS4 and PS4 Pro have a distinct advantage with faster memory ( 8GB GDDR5) while microsoft went with (8GB DDR3)**

**The base PS4 GPU is able to handle more foliage in environments than the base Xbox One**

**Still, PS4 is winning the exclusives war by a mile. Between big hits such as Uncharted 4, Marvel's Spider-Man, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and God of War, the PS4's exclusive offerings include some of the biggest and highest-rated AAA titles of this generation**

**Sony's PlayStation 4 does something the Xbox One does not: virtual reality. Sony's PlayStation VR headset is a unique aspect of the PlayStation 4.**

**Thatâ€™s the main reason for our pick. The PS4 has the best games, and the PS4 Pro makes them look as stunning as possible**

# Xbox contrast
**Microsoft's biggest selling point for the Xbox One over the PlayStation 4 is backward compatibility.**
> extremely complex gamepads

**That said, the Xbox One game library is massive and includes a rich history of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games.**

**In general, Microsoft's approach to gaming with Xbox is friendlier to gamers than Sony's with the PlayStation**

*The Xbox One X has proven far better at using its extra horsepower to improve the visuals of all games on the platform, enhanced or not.*
Microsoft gave us the better hardware in the Xbox One X
