# PS4 contrast
**Ps4 has more of an expensive side but on the bright side Both the PS4 and PS4 Pro have a distinct advantage with faster memory ( 8GB GDDR5) while microsoft went with (8GB DDR3)**

**The base PS4 GPU is able to handle more foliage in environments than the base Xbox One**

**Still, PS4 is winning the exclusives war by a mile. Between big hits such as Uncharted 4, Marvel's Spider-Man, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and God of War, the PS4's exclusive offerings include some of the biggest and highest-rated AAA titles of this generation**
